# Conways Game of Life (2.0)

## Purpose
I wanted to learn what all the fuss about Rust is so I though it would be
fun to rewrite an old project. The original is also on GitHub but I 
recommend not using it for anything but a guide of what not to do.

## Goals
There aren't really any, just make a cool little program in rust.
